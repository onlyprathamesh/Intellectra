| AI Model Performance Issues                | Use multiple models/approaches, monitor performance closely, and have a fallback strategy. |
| Data Security Breaches                      | Implement robust security measures and comply with all relevant data privacy regulations. |
| Development Delays                          | Agile development methodologies, sprint planning, regular progress reviews, contingency planning. |
| Unforeseen Technical Challenges             | Regularly review project progress and adjust plans as needed.  Dedicated problem-solving sessions. |
| Lack of Team Member Availability           | Clear communication channels, contingency planning for potential absences. |
| Budget Overruns                            | Careful tracking of expenses, regular budget reviews, negotiating favorable API contracts. |


**8. Success Metrics:**

* Number of users
* User engagement (application usage, feature adoption)
* Application success rate (tracking job applications resulting in interviews/offers)
* Premium subscription rate

This plan provides a flexible framework. Regular reviews and adjustments will ensure the project stays on track and delivers a successful product.  The Agile methodology will be employed for iterative development and rapid adaptation to changing needs and discoveries.
