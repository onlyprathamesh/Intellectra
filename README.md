# 🧠 Intellectra — Autonomous Market Research & Risk Assessment Agent System

## Problem Statement

In today's dynamic market, startups and investors struggle to validate ideas or assess risks efficiently. Manual research, high-level analysis, and decision-making require time and domain expertise.

**Intellectra** solves this problem by enabling users to input product ideas and receive instant market analysis, risk assessment, and actionable business insights — powered by AI agents.

## 🚀 Why AI Agents?

AI agents are ideal for this use-case due to:

- **Autonomy**: Each agent performs a specialized task independently
- **Collaboration**: Multiple agents interact to deliver end-to-end insights
- **Scalability**: Easily extendable to include more expert agents (e.g., financial analyst, growth hacker)
- **Speed & Efficiency**: Reduces human hours in market research and de-risks early decisions

## 🔍 Use Case Summary

| Component       | Description                                                       |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Input**       | Problem statement or business idea (e.g., "Uber for rural India") |
| **Output**      | Market Research, Competitor Analysis, Risk Factors                |
| **Agents**      | Independent & Collaborative agents                                |
| **Ideal Users** | Entrepreneurs, Startup Founders, Investors                        |

## 🧩 Agents Architecture

### 👨‍💼 Agent Roles

| Agent Name                     | Responsibility                                                |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Researcher Agent**           | Conducts domain-specific research related to the problem      |
| **Competitor Agent**           | Identifies and analyzes existing competitors and gaps         |
|  **Idea Improver Agent**       | Refines the original idea and adds innovative improvements    |
| **Tech Advisor Agent**         | Suggests suitable technology stacks, APIs, tools              |
| **Dev Architect Agent**        | Recommends architecture, databases, scalability plans         |
| **Feasibility Analyzer Agent** | Evaluates market feasibility, risks, and growth opportunities |
| **Summarizer Agent**           | Formats and compiles everything into a final readable summary |

### 🧠 How Agents Work

1. Each agent receives task-specific input from the Coordinator Agent
2. Agents independently utilize tools (search, LLMs) and return results
3. The Coordinator aggregates results, performs formatting, and generates a final summary

## 🛠 Tools, Libraries, and Frameworks

| Category            | Tools & Libraries Used                                    |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Agent Framework** | CrewAI (multi-agent orchestration)                        |
| **Search Tools**    | SerperDevTool, TavilySearchTool (for Google-style search) |
| **Custom Tools**    | MarketResearcher, RiskAssessor (Domain-specific logic)    |
| **LLMs Tested**     | Gemini (via Google Cloud), Mixtral (Open Source)          |
| **Language**        | Python                                                    |

## 🤖 LLM Selection

### ✅ Final Free-tier LLMs Used

| LLM | Use-Case | Reason |
|-----|----------|---------|
| **Gemini (Google Cloud)** | General reasoning & formatting | Stable, fast, free |
| **Claude** | Summarization, formatting insights | Excellent coherence |
| **Perplexity API / Search-optimized models** | Real-time web data | Powerful factual accuracy |

### 🧠 Best LLMs for Ideal Version

| Model          | Justification                             |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Claude 3**   | Most coherent for summarization & writing |
| **Perplexity** | Top-tier for live data + citations        |
| **Gemini Pro** | General-purpose reasoning & performance   |

## 🧪 How to Run the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/onlyprathamesh/Intellectra.git
cd Intellectra
python src/intellectra/main.py --problem "Build an app that solves..."
```

Make sure to configure your API keys for Gemini, Tavily, and Serper in `.env` as described below.

## ⚙️ Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```ini
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key

## UI Screen-shots
> ⚠️ **Note:** The UI currently works perfectly in the local environment. However, it's throwing errors during deployment. Debugging these errors requires multiple LLM API calls, which may exceed the free API usage limits and potentially break the entire multi-agent workflow. Hence, deployment has been temporarily withheld to preserve the project’s integrity.
